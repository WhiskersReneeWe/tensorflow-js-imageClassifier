# tensorflow-js-imageClassifier
## First tinkering with Tensorflow.js
### Siraj' ML Course HW1

### Model Used:
[Mobilenet in JSON Format]('https://storage.googleapis.com/tfjs-models/tfjs/mobilenet_v1_1.0_224/model.json')

### Technologies:

* JQuery, Bootstrap
* Tensorflow.js

### Demo

### Issues

The model doesn't really predict common objects well. Need to find a way to serve the locally trained Keras later on
