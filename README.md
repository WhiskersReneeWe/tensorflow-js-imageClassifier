# First tinkering with Tensorflow.js
#### Siraj' ML Course HW1

## Usage

1. Download all three files in this repo to your local directory.
2. Make sure they are all in the same folder.
3. Open up 'hw1.html' in your browser and upload whatever images you want to classify.
4. That's it. The consequences are yours -- you might be shocked at who you are (see demo)


### Model Used:
[Mobilenet in JSON Format]('https://storage.googleapis.com/tfjs-models/tfjs/mobilenet_v1_1.0_224/model.json')

### Technologies:

* JQuery, Bootstrap
* Tensorflow.js

### App UI (predicting what am I?)

Turns out I might be a 'bib' or a shower curtain. Neither of them is satisfying.

### Issues

The model doesn't really predict common objects well. Need to find a way to serve the locally trained Keras later on
