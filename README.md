# First tinkering with Tensorflow.js
#### [Siraj' ML Course HW1](https://www.machinelearningcourse.io/courses/take/make-money)

## Usage

1. Download all three files in this repo to your local directory.
2. Make sure they are all in the same folder.
3. Open up 'hw1.html' in your browser and upload whatever images you want to classify.
4. That's it. The consequences are yours -- you might be shocked at who you are (see demo)


### Model Used:
[Mobilenet in JSON Format]('https://storage.googleapis.com/tfjs-models/tfjs/mobilenet_v1_1.0_224/model.json')

### Technologies:

* JQuery, Bootstrap
* Tensorflow.js

### App UI 

1. Classify who I am?

Turns out I am a shower curtain or a swing. Neither of them is satisfying. In all seriousness, it might be because my scarf takes too much attention from the model. The predictions on who I am are consistent, which is a good sign. Other predictions are kinda awesome!

### Improvements

Need to find a way to serve the locally trained Keras later on
